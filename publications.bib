	abstract = {While the exchange of cross-border students in Europe has increased significantly in recent years, a growing number of these students face obstacles in selecting courses for exchange. This poster describes the first iteration of creating a course recommendation system for exchange students to select courses that fit their preferences. We implemented a combination of embedding models to enhance the course search and simplified the course selection process. Whereas the students well received the recommendation system, a grey area was found. The results of more advanced embedding models were perceived as less relevant to their expectations.},

	abstract = {The introductory agent-based modeling course we are presenting aims to equip second-year sociology students with basic skills which are critical to transforming their research ideas into theories and computational models. Our course follows a general course on theory construction in social science. As one of the first interactions of undergraduate social science students with computer science concepts, the course partially serves as a CS0 course; however, the main focus is on the higher-level skills needed to model social phenomena. This requires the course to maintain multiple foci on computer science and domain skills. In this paper, we present a course design considerations and establish a foundation for the comparison of agent-based models and the computational thinking and CS0 skills required for undergraduate social scientists studying agent-based modeling.},

	abstract = {In this work, we analyze how the esports transfer market is organized with the help of mixed methods. We assume that a combination of Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning can help to achieve deeper understanding and to find patterns which are hidden from the one-side analysis. For the research, we gathered information about transfers of Dota 2 teams made between The Internationals of 2016 and 2017 and built a network based on this data. For the ERGM, we checked the importance of belonging to one region and organization, difference of skills, and participation in TI, and for association rules, on a par with the regions, we added players roles, and a metric of their personal performance -- fantasy points. Summing up the results, we found out the importance of homophily within regions, detected presence of vertical mobility, and discover the influence of the specific players roles.},

	abstract = {In this work, we analyse the structure of local and regional market of player transfers in popular eSports discipline Dota 2. Together with team performance metrics, these data provide us with an opportunity to model network of transfers between teams. In turn, the transfers show the actual structure of mobility in the industry. We collected the data on playersâ€™ transfers for the top professional teams and their transfer partners, based on transactions between two world tournaments: The International 16 to The International 17. We built a directed network of transfers and analysed centralities, assortative mixing, and link formation.The global transfer market structure is organised around continental regions. At the same time, teams with the same level of performance rarely have transfers. This can be a reliable indicator of the presence of mobility lifts, in this case, mastodons of the tournament accept in their ranks natives of the less rated teams. On the other hand, some successful players may leave the best teams to establish their own, in the same way as top managers leave the large corporations to launch startups.},
